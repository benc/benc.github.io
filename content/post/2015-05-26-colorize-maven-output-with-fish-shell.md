title: Colorize maven output with fish shell
url: /2015/05/26/colorize-maven-output-with-fish-shell/

I'm a [fish shell](http://fishshell.com) user (along with [oh-my-fish](https://github.com/bpinto/oh-my-fish)), and I also happen to encounter [maven](http://maven.apache.org) on a daily basis.

Maven is renowned for it's verbose output, so adding a little color certainly helps to interpret it's output better.

You can add [this fish plugin](https://gist.github.com/benc/a9b74c537f667a8dd28e) to your configured `fish_custom` folder to add some colors to your maven output.
