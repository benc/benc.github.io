The thing is: how do you process media files on a smartphone (iPhone in my case, but the same thing could be said from any other smartphone) and create a unified photo library out of it, on multiple machines?

A great solution to sync stuff between devices is Dropbox. With their Carousel app, it already integrates nicely into my phone, placing new photos into a Camera Roll folder. Dropbox is also available for almost every platform, making this process applicable on more than just an iPhone and a Mac.

        <p>I like to take lots of pictures. I also have multiple macs running, and I wanted some of the photos to appear on one mac, and some of them on the other. I also want to have these photos imported in <a href="http://www.apple.com/osx/photos/">Apple Photos</a>.</p>

<p>The thing is: how do you process media files on a smartphone (iPhone in my case, but the same thing could be said from any other smartphone) and create a unified photo library out of it, on multiple machines?</p>

<p>A great solution to sync stuff between devices is <a href="https://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>. With their <a href="https://carousel.dropbox.com">Carousel</a> app, it already integrates nicely into my phone, placing new photos into a <code>Camera Roll</code> folder. Dropbox is also available for almost every platform, making this process applicable on more than just an iPhone and a Mac.</p>

<p></p>

<p>This is roughly my process:</p>

<p>Take photos, shoot videos.</p>

<p>Carousel uploads all of my photos &amp; videos to the <code>Camera Roll</code> folder.</p>

<p>Process the <code>Camera Roll</code> folder, and moves them to a folder structure <code>Photos &amp; Videos</code> &gt; <code>year</code> &gt; <code>month</code>, that also resides in Dropbox. I&rsquo;m using <a href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php">Hazel</a> for this, and <code>exiftool </code> to pass on the metadata from the photos to Hazel.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/15xizha4o35earx/Camera%20Uploads.hazelrules.zip?dl=1">I have uploaded these Hazel rules here</a>. Note, you probably would want to review and modify these rules according to your taste. These rules require that you have <code>exiftool</code> installed. <a href="http://www.sno.phy.queensu.ca/~phil/exiftool/">Get a binary here</a>.</p>

<p>Process the <code>Photos &amp; Videos</code> folder, and create a photo library for them. I&rsquo;m also using Hazel for this, and it imports every new image and video file into Apple Photos using AppleScript. If it is imported, it is marked with a certain tag. That tag get&rsquo;s synced back to Dropbox. This tag also prevents duplicate imports. <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/s/hqntuzwx7yu3d3u/Add%20to%20Photos.hazelrules.zip?dl=1">These Hazel rules are available here</a>.</p>

<p>This process is not perfect. Moving photos from camera roll to the photos &amp; videos app only is set up on my main machine, making this process a bit brittle.</p>

<p>But apart from this, it works great for me so far. I do not rely on a specific photo management app, so I could switch later on if I wanted to. I could use multiple photo management apps, like Lightroom, if I wanted to. I also have a full photo backup stored in Dropbox. Using <a href="https://www.dropbox.com/help/175">the selective sync feature</a> of Dropbox, I only download the most recent photos onto my machines.</p>
